# System Patterns

**Project Name:** pinc-xyz-yaw

**System Architecture:** The system involves generating data, training a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model, and evaluating/visualizing its performance. Key components seem to be located in `src/`, `data/`, `models/`, `training/`, and `scripts/`.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Use of PyTorch for neural network implementation.
- Physics-Informed Neural Network approach (details TBD).
- Separation of concerns into different directories (data, models, training, scripts).

**Design Patterns in Use:** N/A (Further analysis needed)

**Component Relationships:**
- `scripts/pi_dnn.py`: Loads a pre-trained model from `models/` (specifically `models/pinn_no_rollout_rotated_less_layers_0`). It uses data loading functions likely defined in `models/model_utility.py` (based on imports) which probably process data generated by scripts in `data/`. It performs evaluation and visualization, potentially saving results to `results/`. It utilizes core simulation/model logic from `src/bluerov_torch.py`.
- Other relationships TBD as more components are analyzed.
