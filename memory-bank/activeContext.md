# Active Context

**Project Name:** pinc-xyz-yaw

**Current Work Focus:** Reorganizing the code into a better folder structure, analyzing existing components.

**Recent Changes:**
- Created initial memory bank files.
- Converted `notebooks/pi_dnn.ipynb` to `scripts/pi_dnn.py`.
- Performed detailed analysis of `scripts/pi_dnn.py`: Confirmed it loads a specific pre-trained PINN (`models/pinn_no_rollout_rotated_less_layers_0`), loads development data, and performs both single-step and rollout predictions. It generates various comparison plots (MSE, trajectories, individual states) and calculates losses. Updated `systemPatterns.md` accordingly.

**Next Steps:**
- Update `progress.md` with detailed information about `scripts/pi_dnn.py`.
- Modify `scripts/pi_dnn.py` to save its output plots and potentially results data into a new directory: `results/paper_results/`.
- Execute the modified `scripts/pi_dnn.py` to generate the results.
- Stage and commit all changes (script modifications, memory bank updates, new results).
- Push changes to GitHub.
- Decide whether to delete the original `notebooks/pi_dnn.ipynb`.
- Continue analyzing the project structure for reorganization.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:** N/A
