# Progress

**Project Name:** pinc-xyz-yaw

**What Works:**
- `scripts/pi_dnn.py`: Converted from a notebook, this script loads a pre-trained PINN model (`models/pinn_no_rollout_rotated_less_layers_0`), evaluates its single-step and rollout predictions against development data, and generates comparison plots.

**What's Left to Build:**
- Reorganize the overall code structure.
- Update requirements file (`requirements.txt`).
- Update `README.md`.
- Potentially train or refine models (current script uses a pre-trained one).
- Define clear data generation/processing pipelines.

**Current Status:** Analyzing existing components and planning reorganization. Converted and analyzed `pi_dnn` notebook/script.

**Known Issues:** N/A
