# Active Context

**Project Name:** pinc-xyz-yaw

**Current Work Focus:** Reorganizing the code into a better folder structure, analyzing existing components.

**Recent Changes:**
- Created initial memory bank files.
- Converted `notebooks/pi_dnn.ipynb` to `scripts/pi_dnn.py`.
- Analyzed `scripts/pi_dnn.py`: It's an evaluation and visualization script for a pre-trained PINN model, comparing predictions (single-step and rollout) against development data.

**Next Steps:**
- Update `progress.md` and `systemPatterns.md` with information about `scripts/pi_dnn.py`.
- Decide whether to delete the original `notebooks/pi_dnn.ipynb`.
- Continue analyzing the project structure for reorganization.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:** N/A
